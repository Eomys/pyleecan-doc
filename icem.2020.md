Abstract
--------

Breakthrough innovations in electrical machines may be limited by parametric overlays 
and templates provided in commercial electromagnetic simulation software. Disruptive 
design spaces must therefore be explored using more flexible open-source software solutions. 
However, a significant scripting effort is necessary to define some new parametric geometries 
suitable for design optimization based on open source multiphysics solvers. This article 
illustrates the use of Pyleecan open-source simulation software under Python to more 
efficiently model, evaluate and optimize disruptive topologies of 2D or 3D electrical machines. 
The current status of Pyleecan initiative is first presented. Then, the principle and the advantages 
of the object-oriented approach of electrical machines are detailed. Some examples of complex innovative 
topologies that can be generated with Pyleecan are then introduced (e.g. complex winding, uneven slot 
types, multiple rotor and stators), as well as the optimization possibilities. Finally, the development 
roadmap of Pyleecan project is given.
