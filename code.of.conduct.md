Code of conduct
===============

Working within a multi-cultural community of developers can be
challenging. It is the responsibility of PYLEECAN maintainers to make
sure that the community remains friendly and professional when
collaborating on PYLEECAN software development. A code of conduct is a
way to point out behaviors that are not acceptable (e.g. sexism,
harassment, trolling, racism). The code of conduct of the PYLEECAN
project will be based on [Django code of conduct](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/).

The following rule is added:

“PYLEECAN is a scientific project which aims at catalyzing applied
research in electrical machines and drives. A great diversity of
modeling approaches and topologies will be progressively included,
representing the diversity of electrical system applications. Therefore,
there is no such thing as “a bad model” or “a useless topology”, there
are only different approaches to simulate the same thing with different
advantages and drawbacks.”
