Slot Conventions
================

For the definition of the slot geometry with build_geometry() the
following conventions are used: 

- Start and end points of the curve
defining a slot shape should be on the lamination bore radius. 
- Line objects are defined in the trigonometric direction (therefore the
imaginary part of the first point is negative and the one of the last
point is positive). 
- All the coordinates are by default returned withthe Ox axis as the symmetries axis of the slot (or in the middle of the
slot opening if the slot is not symmetrical). 
- Points are named Px, their complex coordinate is Zx. The arc center points are named Pcx in
schematics.

-   The top of the slot is the part closest to the bore radius, the
    bottom of the slot is the part closest to the yoke (for both outer
    and inner rotor).
-   The slot bottom radius is the radius of the point which is the
    furthest from the bore.
-   The slot height is defined as the difference between the bore radius
    and the slot bottom radius.
-   The top of the slot surface is always defined by the lamination bore
    radius (therefore, the small arc surface needs to be taken into
    account in the slot surface calculation).
-   The yoke surface is defined as the cylinder between the slot top
    radius and the radius of the lamination which is not the bore radius
    (Rext for external lamination).
-   The teeth surface (and therefore the teeth) is defined as the
    remaining surface between the bore radius and the slot bottom
    radius.

-   The opening angle of the slot is the angle of the arc fromed by the
    first and last points of the slot along the lamination bore radius,
    with O=(0,0) as the center.
-   The equivalent winding angle is the angle of the equivalent polar
    geometry of the slot winding surface. This equivalent polar geometry
    is defined assuming the same height as the real winding, the angle
    being such as the equivalent polar surface equals the real winding
    surface.
-   The winding height is defined as the difference between the slot
    bottom radius and the radius of the closest winding point from the
    lamination bore.
-   The opening height is defined as the difference between the radius
    of the closest winding point from the lamination bore and the
    lamination bore radius.
-   The mid-winding radius is defined as the slot top radius minus half
    the winding height for external lamination, or as the slot top
    radius plus half the winding height for internal lamination.

Several of these methods use polar definitions for the height or for the angle to be able to easily define a polar equivalent of the machine (for instance for subdomain model -- Magnetic module).

All the SlotWind objects have the following methods: 
- _comp_coordinates(): (optional) Returns a list of the complex point coordinates in the order (P1, P2, P3...). If there are some arcs 
between the points (for instance an arc between (P2, P3) of center Pc1), the convention is to return the center coordinates too (P1, P2, Pc1, P3, P4 ...) 
- build_geometry(): Returns a list of Line objects that enables to draw in 2D one slot in trigonometric direction (no bore arc, the beginning of each Line is the end of the previous one). 
- build_geometry_wind(): Returns a list of Surface objects that enables to draw in 2D the winding zones (taking 2 integer, Nrad and Ntan, as arguments to set the number of winding zones to be drawn). 
- check(): Checks that all the geometrical constraints are respected, throw exceptions otherwise. 
- comp_angle_opening(): Returns the opening angle of the slot. 
- comp_angle_wind_eq(): Returns the equivalent angle of the winding part of the slot (method of SlotWind). 
- comp_height(): Returns the slot's height. 
- comp_height_wind(): Computes the winding's height. 
- comp_surface(): Computes the surface of a single slot. 
- comp_surface_wind(): Computes the winding's maximum theoretical active surface. 
- comp_radius_mid_wind(): Computes the mid winding radius (method of SlotWind).
