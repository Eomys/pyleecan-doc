Tutorials
=========

The purpose of this section is to present some global tutorial on how to
use Pyleecan. These first tutorials are an introduction to Pyleecan that
we recommand to read in order.

* [How to define a machine](tuto_Machine.md)
* [How to define a simulation to call FEMM](tuto_Simulation_FEMM.md) 
* [How to plot results](tuto_Plots.md)
* [How to set the Operating Point](tuto_Operating_point.md)
* [How to compute currents, voltage and torque using the Electrical Module](tuto_Elec.md)
* [How to compute magnetic forces using Force Module](tuto_Force.md)
* [How to solve optimization problem in Pyleecan](tuto_Optimization.md) 
* [How to run a multi-simulation](tuto_multisimulation.md)
* [How to add a new slot in Pyleecan](tuto.add.slot.md)

How to run the tutorial
-----------------------

Each tutorial is generated from a Jupyter Notebook and can be downloaded
[on GitHub](https://github.com/Eomys/pyleecan/tree/master/Tutorials). To
run the tutorials notebook, here is the full procedure:

- Install the latest version of [Anacoda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
- Open an "Anaconda Prompt" and run the command "pip install pyleecan"
- Install the latest version of [FEMM](http://www.femm.info/wiki/Download) (Windows only)
- Download the tutorial notebooks on your computer
- Open the program "Anaconda Navigator" and launch "Jupyter Notebook"

- Double click on the notebook to run

Anaconda include the IDE "Spyder" that enables to read notebook.

Validation simulations are also available in the Tests/Validation folder
for inspiration.
