Python
======

Prerequisites
-------------

PYLEECAN is developed (for now) in Python 3.5. Python 3 has been chosen
to be up to date with the latest developments of Python language and its
main packages. Python 3.5 or further versions, are used to be able to
use the package PyInstaller to generate an .exe file of the program. A
compatibility with Python 2.7 can be considered if needed by the
community. In this case, we would need to use unittest to make sure that
PYLEECAN runs on both versions.

Installation
------------

To install the latest version of Python, download the
[installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and run it.

PYLEECAN will use others python scientific packages like NumPy,
MatplotLib, etc. To install those packages we recommend you to use
**pip**, a python package manager which is already installed if your
python version is \>= 3.4.

You can find listed below all the packages used in PYLEECAN:

-   ddt
-   pytest
-   definitions
-   cloudpickle
-   numpy
-   scipy
-   matplotlib
-   pyfemm

-   pandas
-   PySide2
-   xlrd
-   deap
-   SciDataTool
-   pyvista
-   meshio

To install all these packages, copy them in a text file
(requirements.txt) and run :: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
