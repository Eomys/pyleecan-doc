Tutorials
=========

The purpose of this section is to present some global tutorial on how to
use Pyleecan. These first tutorials are an introduction to Pyleecan that
we recommand to read in order.

* [How to define a machine](tuto_Machine.md)
* [How to define a simulation to call FEMM](tuto_Simulation_FEMM.md) 
* [How to plot results](tuto_Plots.md)
* [How to set the Operating Point](tuto_Operating_point.md)
* [How to compute currents, voltage and torque using the Electrical Module](tuto_Elec.md)
* [How to compute magnetic forces using Force Module](tuto_Force.md)
* [How to solve optimization problem in Pyleecan](tuto_Optimization.md) 
* [How to run a multi-simulation](tuto_multisimulation.md)
* [How to add a new slot in Pyleecan](tuto.add.slot.md)
* [How to run a Parameter Sweep of Variable speed simulation](tuto_MultiSim.md)

How to run the tutorial
-----------------------

Each tutorial is generated from a Jupyter Notebook and can be seen
[on GitHub](https://github.com/Eomys/pyleecan/tree/master/Tutorials) or downloaded in [this archive](_static/Release/1_4_0/Tutorials.zip). To
run the tutorials notebook, here is the procedure:

    - pip install jupyter
    - open a console terminal in the folder containing the Tutorials
    - run the command "jupyter notebook"

The notebook should then be available in your web browser.

Validation simulations are also available in the [Tests/Validation](https://github.com/Eomys/pyleecan/tree/master/Tests/Validation) folder
for inspiration.

Webinar
-------

Three public and free webinars have been organized by [Green Forge Coop](https://www.linkedin.com/company/greenforgecoop/about/) and UNICAS University in 2020. Warning some information from these webinar are outdated ! 
The webinar resources are available here:

-   [How to use pyleecan (basics)? Pyleecan basics, call of FEMM, use of the GUI (2020/10/16)](webinar_1.md)
-   [How to use pyleecan (advanced)? Optimization tools, meshing, plot commands (2020/10/30)](webinar_2.md)
-   [How to contribute to pyleecan? Github projects, Object Oriented Programming (2020/11/06)](webinar_3.md)

The current version of pyleecan may be different from the one presented during the webinars. The latest versions of the notebooks are available on Github.
