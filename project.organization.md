Project organization
====================

This page introduces the PYLEECAN file organization: you will find out
how the modules are sorted and what are the folders in the project. We
will also talk about PYLEECAN repositories.

File organization
-----------------

The files of PYLEECAN 1.0 are sorted in several folders according to the
following rules:

-   **Classes** folder contains all the classes built by the [code generator](class.generation.md).

-   **Methods** folder contains all the methods of the classes sorted in
    subfolder by types:

    -   Machine
    -   Slot
    -   Simulation
    -   Material
    -   etc .
    
    These methods are imported and assigned to the correct class
    during the automated code generation. The method of a class can
    also be sorted in separated folders.

-   **GUI** folder contains the code for the Graphical User Interface
    sorted by widget.

-   **Function** folder contains general functions that can be used by
    several methods (for instance FFT computation, interaction with
    other software\...).

-   **Tests** folder contains all the unittest and the validation cases.
    The subfolders follow the organization of the tested folders
    (Classes, Methods, GUI\...).

PYLEECAN repositories
---------------------

PYLEECAN has currently two repositories:

-   [pyleecan](https://github.com/Eomys/pyleecan) for the python code
-   [pyleecan-doc](https://github.com/Eomys/pyleecan-doc) for PYLEECAN
    documentation (this website).
