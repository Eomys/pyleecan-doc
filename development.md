Development guidelines
======================

We are pleased to welcome you on the PYLEECAN development guidelines
page. One interest of an open-source initiative is to share ideas with a
community and develop together the project. We are interested in all
sorts of contributions (new features, documentation, etc.) and we will
be glad to include yours in the project.

Before starting to contribute, make sure that you have
[a working pyleecan](get.pyleecan.md) and that you know
[how to use it](tutorials.md).

What to contribute to ?
-----------------------

Pyleecan offers a great diversity of potential contributions:

-   new tutorials or student courses in electric machine design based on
    Jupyter interactive notebooks
-   new slot or pocket parametric geometries for Pyleecan geometrical
    modeller
-   new electrical machine topologies (e.g. magnetic gears, brushless
    doubly fed machines, linear motors)
-   new magnetic models (e.g. coupling with Ansys Maxwell, Magnetic
    Equivalent Circuits, subdomain models)
-   new multiphysic models (e.g. coupling with Elmer to perform
    mechanical stress analysis of lamination)
-   new validation tests (e.g. experimental data to check model results)

- new feature developments (see dedicated [Github issue
page](https://github.com/Eomys/pyleecan/issues)).

[The Github issue page](https://github.com/Eomys/pyleecan/issues) gather what the
community is currently thinking and talking about. Feel free to answer a
specific issue, open your own issue, or ask how to further help the
community on an existing feature request.

Contributing Guidelines
-----------------------

To ensure the quality of the code within the project, this page gathers
several guidelines. The idea is to have a clean and homogeneous code to
make sure that anyone can understand it and contribute and that all
contributions can be used by anyone. You don't have to follow all the
guidelines, but it will be easier to include your modifications if you
do. We have sorted the guidelines in three groups:


* [Code Contribution](code.contribution.md)
    * [Talk about it](code.contribution.md#talk-about-it)
    * [Contribute to the code](code.contribution.md#contribute-to-the-code)
    * [Submit your contribution](code.contribution.md#submit-your-contribution)
* [Doc Contribution](doc.contributions.md)
    * [Docstring & Sphinx](doc.contribution.md#docstring-sphinx)
    * [Doc contributing guidelines](doc.contribution.md#doc-contributing-guidelines)
* [Test Contribution](tests_tutorials/test.contribution.Pyleecan.md)
