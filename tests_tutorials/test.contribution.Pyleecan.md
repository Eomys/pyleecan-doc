# Tutorial to contribute to the tests in Pyleecan

Testing is absolutely essential when developping a software or any IT solution. Any new feature added in Pyleecan should come along with its own tests, and tests should be launched before any pull request.
This tutorial explains how to launch tests and how to contribute to tests:

* [What is a test](what.is.a.test.md)
* [How to use pytest](how.to.use.pytest.md)
* [How to use markers](how.to.use.markers.md)
* [How to parametrize](how.to.parametrize.md)
* [Make a typical Pyleecan test](typical.pyleecan.GUI.test.md)
* [How to contribute to test development](how.to.contribute.md)
* [How to unit test the GUI](how.to.unit.test.GUI.md)
* [How to debug with pytest](how.to.debug.with.pytest.md)
* [More Conventions](more.conventions.md)


**Please note**, if you don't have time to develop tests, please talk about what are the expected results of your model / topology on the Github issues (or in the code itself). We are always looking for validation data, simulation results, experimental measurements, new machines, publications... Anything that can help us making sure that our models are working and will always be.
