=======

PYLEECAN is under an **Apache license**. This license is permissive
(with no copyleft) which allows the use of PYLEECAN with in a
close-source commercial software. One of the key features of PYLEECAN is
it flexibility: the possibility to be coupled with almost any software
(with proper import function or with direct coupling). With this
license, a private company may include PYLEECAN in their simulation
software without having to provide the code of the resulting software.

Companies may keep part of their work with PYLEECAN confidential, but
they will be more prone to contribute to the open-source project to
increase its reliability (implementation of special validation cases
related to the company applications) and durability (compatibility of
new PYLEECAN versions to companyâ€™s software). On the contrary, with a
copyleft license like GPL, some company may refuse to base their work on
PYLEECAN to protect their innovative software developments. The Apache
license was chosen to enlarge as much as possible potential
contributors.

EOMYS intends to include PYLEECAN to its commercial software MANATEE.
That way, EOMYS aims at supporting the development of PYLEECAN
open-source software with full-time developers based on the revenues of
MANATEE commercial software.
