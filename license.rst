PYLEECAN is under an **Apache license**. This license is permissive (with no copyleft) which allows the use of PYLEECAN with
in a close-source commercial software. One of the key features of PYLEECAN is it flexibility: the possibility to be coupled
with almost any software (with proper import function or with direct coupling). With this license, a private company
may include PYLEECAN in their  simulation software without having to provide the code of the resulting software.

Companies may keep part of their work with PYLEECAN confidential, but they will be  more  prone  to  contribute
to  the  open-source  project  to  increase  its  reliability (implementation  of  special  validation  cases  related
to  the  company  applications)  and durability  (compatibility  of  new  PYLEECAN  versions to  company’s  software).
On  the contrary, with a copyleft license like GPL, some company may refuse to base their work on PYLEECAN to protect
their innovative software developments. The Apache license was chosen to enlarge as much as possible potential contributors.

EOMYS intends to include PYLEECAN to its commercial software MANATEE. That way, EOMYS aims at supporting
the development of PYLEECAN open-source software with full-time developers based on the revenues of MANATEE commercial
software.
