Output object
##############

The  Output  class  is  composed  of  several  subclasses  corresponding  to physical  domain (Output.Electrical,
Output.Structural...).  The  Output  object  is instantiated  by  the  Simulation  method run(). Each  Output
sub-object  (i.e.  physics) contains mostly the same data, organized in the same way whatever model was used to compute it.
For instance an Output.Magnetics will contains the airgap flux matrix (defined in the same way) whether it was computed by
an analytical model or the coupling with FEMM.

Each model return a core set of output and can add its own dedicated output and post-processing if needed. For instance, one
can store the mesh generated by FEMM in the output object for later use. The core set of output enables to make sure that the
post-process will work regardless of how it was computed and the dedicated output enables to go further for each model.

PYLEECAN also includes options to select how many output data should be saved in the Output object. From keep everything
to only the strict minimum (with the constraints that some post-processing may not be available). This option is particularly
important for multi-simulations like optimization.
