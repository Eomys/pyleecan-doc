Machine & Simulation objects
============================

In the Machine class, the machine methods are only meant to provide
“intrinsic” quantities of the machine (e.g. geometrical quantities,
weights). This constraint helps differentiating the methods between the
Machine and the Simulation objects. When adding a new machine topology,
one must be sure that it works with all the simulation possibilities of
PYLEECAN.

Methods organization
--------------------

The object-oriented approach helps to integrate a new topology by
listing all the methods that need to be implemented. Therefore, to ease
the creation of new topologies, the number of methods in the machine
object must be limited.

As an example, the Machine methods include a comp_coefficient_Carter()
(calculation of the Carter slotting coefficient) and a
comp_resistance_winding() method (calculation of the total electric
resistance per phase), but no comp_flux_airgap() nor
comp_circuit_equivalent() method in the Machine. The methods
comp_flux_airgap() and comp_circuit_equivalent() are defined within
the Simulation object and sorted by physics. This way, the Machine
object provides a unified and simplified framework to handle the machine
topology and the Simulation project splits and organizes the different
models.

Constraints
-----------

This philosophy implies several constraints on the code organization.
When coupling PYLEECAN with FEMM magnetostatics solver to compute the
airgap flux distribution, one simple possibility would be to add a
draw_femm() method in Machine and all its subclasses to define the
geometry in FEMM in one call. The problem with this method is that the
code for FEMM coupling would then be split between Machine and
Simulation objects, and adding a new machine topology would then require
to define another draw_femm() method, even if the machine was not
intended for FEMM simulation. Another issue is that the Machine objects
would need a dedicated draw method for each software (e.g. Ansys, Flux,
Code_Aster) that would replicate part of the code of draw_femm().

Solution
--------

The solution is to create a build_geometry() method in Machine class
that returns a unified geometry representation of the machine (though a
list of Surface) which is intrinsic of the machine and not
model-dependent. Then, each software coupling should call this method to
draw the machine accordingly. With this coding principle, all the
model-related code is in the corresponding Simulation part, and when
adding a new topology, implementing the build_geometry() method should
make it compatible with all the existing models. The coupling with ansys
will also call the build_geometry to know what to draw and then the
"how to draw" will change according to the simulation object methods.
