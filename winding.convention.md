Winding convention
==================

Connection matrix
-----------------

For the winding connection matrix, Pyleecan provides several automated
winding algorithms that correspond to the daugthers of the "Winding
class" (in particular, the "comp_connection_mat" method) The
winding connection matrix is a matrix representing the number of turns
and current direction inside each Slot layer. The shape of this matrix
is (Nlay_rad, Nlay_tan, Zs, qs):

-   Nlay_rad and Nlay_tan are the number of radial and tangential
    layers in each slot.
-   Zs is the number of slots (see Figure below).
-   qs the number of phases.

The winding connection matrix is a matrix of relative integer.
wind_mat\[a,b,c,d\] is the number of coil turns Ntcoil in the layer
(a,b) of the Slot nÂ°c for the phase d. If the number of turns is
positive (resp. negative), the winding is going towards the reader along
Oz+ (resp Oz-). The sum of all elements of the winding connection matrix
for any phase is null.

The "tangential layers" are defined in the trigonometric way, and
"radial layers" from top to bottom slot (i.e. from the lamination bore
to the yoke). The slots are filled in the trigonometric direction.

Winding architecture
--------------------

In Pyleecan, the following naming convention is used:

-   A wire is the smallest active element in a winding -- it can have a round or rectangular cross section.
-   A conductor is made of one or several wires in parallel, which can be vertically or horizontally stacked for rectangular wires, or
    randomly placed for round wires. This is an object that is physically manipulated during the winding process.
-   A coil is a set of conductors going from one slot to another with a
    certain number of turns in series ("number of turns per coil").
-   A winding is the arrangement of different coils associated to
    different phase currents, which can be stacked in slots along
    different layers and connected in series or in parallel.
