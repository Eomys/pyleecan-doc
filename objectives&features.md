Objectives & features
=====================

Objectives
----------

PYLEECAN's objective is to provide a user-friendly, unified, flexible
simulation framework for the multiphysic design and optimization of
electrical machines and drives based on open-source software. It is
meant to be used by researchers, R&D engineers and teachers in
electrical engineering, both on standard topologies of electrical
machines and on novel topologies (e.g. during a PhD work). An objective
of PYLEECAN is that every PhD student should start with PYLEECAN instead
of implementing his own routines (e.g. coupling Scilab and Femm).

Features
--------

PYLEECAN will include all the following key features to fulfill its
objectives:
