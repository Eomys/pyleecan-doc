Output object
=============

The Output class is composed of several subclasses corresponding to
physical domains (Output.Electrical, Output.Structural\...). The Output
object is instantiated by the Simulation method run(). Each Output
sub-object (i.e. physics) contains mostly the same data, organized in
the same way whatever model was used to compute it. For instance an
Output.Magnetics will contain the airgap flux matrix (defined in the
same way) whether it was computed by an analytical model or the coupling
with FEMM.

Each model returns a core set of output and can add its own dedicated
output and post-processing if needed. For instance, one can store the
mesh generated by FEMM in the output object for later use. The core set
of output enables to make sure that the post-process will work
regardless of how it was computed and the dedicated output enables to go
further for each model.

PYLEECAN also includes options to select how many output data should be
saved in the Output object. From keep everything to only the strict
minimum (with the constraints that some post-processing may not be
available). This option is particularly important for multi-simulations
like optimization.
