Generation process
==================

All the generation code is gathered in **pyleecan/Generator**. To
simplify all the process, we have split the generation of the code in
several independent steps. The first one is to read all the CSV files to
create a complex structure (dictionary gen_dict) with all the reference
data. The second one is to use this structure to generate the classes.
As the steps are separated, they can evolve separately. For instance,
you can change the way the data is stored in the CSV file without
changing the generation, as long as you keep the data structure
organization.

The gen_dict structure
-----------------------

**The structure gen_dict** is a dictionary gathering all the reference
data for all the classes. It is the structure that is generated by the
first step and which is used to generate the code.

**The structure gen_dict** is composed of several imbricated lists and
dicts. The first level is a dictionary with the group ‘Slot’, ‘Machine’…
as key and dictionary as value. This first level matches the group
separation of CSV files.

At the second level, we have the content of a CSV file as a dictionary,
with CSV name (class name) as key and dictionary as value.

The third level corresponds to the data of a class (or the sheet of the
CSV file). These new dictionaries contain the following keys:

-   [properties](green): a list of dictionaries with key matching the CSV sheet
    column: name, type, min, max, value, desc (one dictionary for each
    property of the class)
-   [constants](green): a list of dictionaries with the key name, value (one for
    each constant of the class)
-   [methods](green): a list of all the class method names
-   [daughters](green): a list of all the class daughter names (generated
    according to the "mother" columns)
-   [package](green): name of the group of the class (same as the first
    dictionary key, but useful for generation)
-   [desc](green): a string with the description of the class (for help text)
-   [mother](green): a string with the mother class name (if empty, FrozenClass
    will be used as default)
-   [path](green): path to the corresponding csv file

For instance, the description of the parameter H0 of Slot_Type_1_0 is
stored in:
gen_dict[‘Slot’][‘Slot_Type_1_0’][‘properties’][0][‘desc’] (if we
suppose that H0 is first in the list of properties).

Note that a feature has been added to enable to generate "your own
pyleecan" with internal code you don't intend to share. More information
on the [corresponding
issue](https://github.com/Eomys/pyleecan/issues/46).

File organization
-----------------

The gen_dict structure is then used for the class generation. The
corresponding code can be found in **/Generator/class_generator.py**
file. Note that some common functions have been gathered in read_fct.

To gain in readability, the generated files have been split in several
parts and some functions have been dedicated to generate specific parts
of the code. The generation process is very complex since there are many
possible cases. For instance, we need to adapt the code according to the
type of property (a PYLEECAN type would need the corresponding import at
the start of the file, some classes are inherited, some are not, some
use numpy array, some don’t…). If you need to change this code, please
consider that it should work for every single class in PYLEECAN: always
start by modifying the class generation and then check that all the
tests still pass.

The results are saved in **pyleecan/Classes/\<Class Name\>.py**. As
these files are completely rewritten by the generator, you must never
modify them yourself. If you need to change the code of the generator,
you should start by looking at these files (for different cases
with/without PYLEECAN classes, with/without inheritance…) to know what
you need to generate.
