Abstract
--------

This paper presents the first open-source development project for the electromagnetic 
design optimization of electrical machines and drives named Pyleecan – PYthon Library 
for Electrical Engineering Computational ANalysis. This paper first details the objectives 
of Pyleecan open-source development project, and the object-oriented architecture of the 
software that has been developed and released. Then it reviews and compares the available 
free and open-source software used during the multiphysic design of electrical machines 
including electromagnetics, heat transfer and vibro-acoustic analysis.
