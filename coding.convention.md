Coding convention
=================

PEP8
----

PYLEECAN will be developed in Python with an oriented object approach to
provide a « simple » code that anyone can contribute to. Python is a
language that was thought to be readable. The Python community has
written some rules about how a good readable Python code should be
written. These rules are known as the Python Enhancement Proposal 8
(PEP8): https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/.

The **PYLEECAN project follows the PEP8 rules** to unify the coding
style of all the contributors. The code will be more homogenous and
understandable this way. Some tools are used to « correct » any Python
script to follow the PEP8 rules. For PYLEECAN modules, we will use
[Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Naming convention
-----------------

The PEP8 conversion scripts can’t correct all the PEP8 rules. For
instance, the PEP8 provides some naming convention. In this paragraph
some naming conventions of PYLEECAN project are detailed, as well as
global coding rules to improve the code quality.

-   According to PEP8: Class names must follow CamelCase naming (Each
    new word is capitalized without underscore)


    | <span style="color:red">NOT TO DO</span> | Lam_squirrel_Cage | Name of squirrel cage rotor class |
    | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
    | <span style="color:green">TO DO</span>   | LamSquirrelCage   |                                   |


-   According to PEP8, function and variable names should be lowercase
    with words separated by underscores. In PYLEECAN, small exceptions
    are made to this rule: a method or a variable name can have
    capitalized letter if and only if it follows physical quantities
    (radius=R, number=N or Z, length=L etc). For instance, Zs is used
    for the number of slots or Rbo for the lamination bore radius.

    
    | <span style="color:red">NOT TO DO</span> | S=compSurfaceRadiation()   | Calculates the radiation surface |
    | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
    | <span style="color:green">TO DO</span>   | S=comp_surface_radiation() |                                  |
    
    
-   For functions that compute some numerical quantities, called
    “computation functions” (in the sense that mathematical operations
    are carried on numerical data, even a simple multiplication), the
    convention is to start the name by “comp_” like “computation”. By
    default, a “comp_” function will return the corresponding numerical
    value (a series of scalar, vector, matrices) and the calling
    function stores it in the Output object. That way the user can find
    all the available computation by typing “.comp_”.


    | <span style="color:red">NOT TO DO</span> | B=flux_airgap_SDM()      | Calculates airgap flux with SubDomain Model |
    | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
    | <span style="color:green">TO DO</span>   | B=comp_flux_airgap_SDM() |                                             |

    
-   When a computation function computes and returns several numerical
    values, these values are stored in a dictionary, and the keys are
    the same as the names used in the Output object to be easily set
    (e.g. Output.Geometry.Smag stores the surface of magnets calculated
    with Smag=comp_surface_magnet()).

    
    | <span style="color:red">NOT TO DO</span> | S=comp_surface_magnet() </br>  Output.Geometry.Smag=S     |
    | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
    | <span style="color:green">TO DO</span>   | Smag=comp_surface_magnet() </br> Output.Geomtry.Smag=Smag |

    
-   For computation functions, the physical type of computation should
    be used first in the name of the function (surface, resistance,
    inductance…). This way, the user can more easily access to unknown
    methods by listing all the computation commands with tab completion
    key (to find the methods calculating torque, comp_torque+tab key
    gives comp_torque_Maxwell(), comp_torque_equivalent_circuit()
    etc.)

    
    | <span style="color:red">NOT TO DO</span> | comp_radiation_surface() </br> comp_Maxwell_torque() |
    | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
    | <span style="color:green">TO DO</span>   | comp_surface_radiation() </br> comp_torque_Maxwell() |
    
    
-   Computation function names can be abbreviated with predefined
    abbreviations (see CSV sheet PYLEECAN scripting conventions
    table.csv), for instance comp_ind_leak_ew_ANL() to compute
    analytically (ANL) the end-winding (ew) leakage (leak) inductance
    (ind).

    
    | <span style="color:red">NOT TO DO</span> | comp_inductance_leakage_endwinding_analytic |
    | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
    | <span style="color:green">TO DO</span>   | comp_ind_leak_ew_ANL()                      |
    
    
-   By default, plural “s” should not be used the function names
    (comp_force and not comp_forces).

    
    | <span style="color:red">NOT TO DO</span> | comp_forces_magnetic() |
    | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
    | <span style="color:green">TO DO</span>   | comp_force_magnet()    |
    
    
-   As much as possible, computation functions should not use the Output
    object as an input argument (except for the most complex ones such
    as comp_displacement). The argument is explicitly listed and
    fetched in the Output object by the calling function. This way, it
    is easier to know the input data necessary to call a given
    computation function, optional arguments can be added with explicit
    docstrings, and the call is easier because it doesn’t require to
    create an Output object.


    | <span style="color:red">NOT TO DO</span> | comp_vol_mag(Output)     | Calculates the volume of magnets </br> with  Output.Geometry.Smag, </br> Output.Geometry.Lmag etc |
    | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | <span style="color:green">TO DO</span>   | comp_vol_mag(Smag, Lmag) | Calculates directly the volume of </br> magnets with Smag, Lmag, etc                              |

    
-   All the hidden internal methods (or properties) that the user
    shouldn’t use should start with underscore “_” for instance:
    _comp_point_coordinates is a private method

    
    | <span style="color:red">NOT TO DO</span> | comp_point_coordinates()  | Private method calculating a point coordinates |
    | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
    | <span style="color:green">TO DO</span>   | _comp_point_coordinates() |                                                |

    
-   As much as possible, getters should be used to ease further
    evolutions. For instance, instead of directly accessing the
    Frame.Wfra property, a get_width() method of the Frame returning
    Wfra should be implemented. PYLEECAN 1.0 contains a single Frame
    object (circular frame), but there might be new ones. If the
    Simulation objects use the get_width() method, creating a new Frame
    object (rectangular for instance) would “only” require to have the
    get_width() method implemented to be compatible with all the code.


    | <span style="color:red">NOT TO DO</span> | Frame.width       | Direct access to an object attribute |
    | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
    | <span style="color:green">TO DO</span>   | Frame.get_width() | Access through a getter              |


    
-   The set of functions that computes a physical quantity based on some
    another physical quantity (e.g. calculation of magnetic flux based
    on electrical currents) is called a “module” – it can be seen as a
    transfer function from one physics to another. The modelling
    methodology used to run the calculations in this module is called a
    “model”. This model may be only valid when fulfilling some specific
    conditions – additional model parameters are called “assumptions”.
    As an example, the Structural “module” contains an Analytical
    “model” with different boundary conditions “assumptions”.

Commit message convention
-------------------------

When committing modifications, we add a tag at the beginning of the
commit message to indicate the nature of the commit:

-   [VI]: (Version Information) Main development step achieved or
    meaningful version of the software
-   [NF]: (New Feature) Something important have been added and works (a
    new function, a new post-treatment…)
-   [BC]: (Bug Correction) A bug was corrected (the message should
    contain description of the bug or the corresponding issue number)
-   [WP]: (Work in Progress) Some intermediate changes leading to BC /
    NF
-   [CO]: (Code Optimization) No new functionality but the scripting is
    improved in terms of clarity, CPU time, etc
-   [CC]: (Code Cleaning) Nearly “passive” development (comments added,
    split of function in several functions, typo correction...)
-   [VR]: (Variable Renaming) Change of variable or class name,
    important to be tagged separately

When possible, please refer to the corresponding issue in your commit
message with #\<issue number\>, Github will automatically add a link to
the commit in the issue.
